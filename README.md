üíª Laptop Price Prediction

This project predicts laptop prices based on hardware and software specifications using machine learning pipelines. It covers the full data science workflow, from data cleaning to model deployment.

üìå Project Overview
The goal is to help users, retailers, and tech enthusiasts estimate the market value of laptops based on features like RAM, CPU, GPU, storage, screen type, and brand.


1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Cleaning
- Removed duplicates and handled missing values
- Standardized inconsistent entries in `OS`, and `brand` names
- Filtered out corrupted or irrelevant records

2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing
- One-Hot Encoding for categorical features: `Company`, `TypeName`, `Cpu Brand`, `Gpu Brand`, `OS`
- StandardScaler applied to numerical features: `Ram`, `Weight`, `HDD`, `SSD`, `PPI`
- Binary conversion for `Touchscreen` and `IPS` flags

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized price distributions and feature correlations
- Compared brand-wise pricing trends
- Identified key features affecting laptop prices: RAM, CPU/GPU brand, SSD/HDD, PPI, Brand

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Engineering
- Computed Pixels Per Inch (PPI) from screen resolution and size for representation
- Extracted CPU/GPU brand from full processor names
- Created binary indicators for touchscreen and IPS display

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Selection
- Selected features that have a strong correlation with price and reduce redundancy.
- Used domain knowledge and correlation heatmaps to choose top predictors:

6Ô∏è‚É£ Model Building with Data Pipelines

- Built pipelines using ColumnTransformer for preprocessing and model training in one step.
  Tested multiple models:

- 1.Linear Regression
- 2.Random Forest Regressor
- 3.XGBoost Regressor
- Evaluated models using MSE, RMSE, and R¬≤ Score.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Model Deployment
- Saved the best-performing pipeline using pickle for future predictions:
- Built a Streamlit web app to allow users to input laptop specs and get real-time price predictions.

Tech Stack:
Python: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Deployment: Streamlit
Data Handling: Pickle

üìä Key Takeaways
- RAM, CPU/GPU, storage type, and display quality are major drivers of laptop prices.
- Pipeline-based workflows make preprocessing, training, and predictions seamless.
- The deployed app allows real-world usage for estimating laptop prices effectively.
